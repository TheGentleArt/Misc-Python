  Python script to aid in analyzing vibration test data from a specific test done at work. Pulls data from a csv file, finds resultants of x,y,z of accelerometer data, re-organizes some channels and saves that to a directory. Then finds FFT and saves that data. Filters data by engine speed, plots RMS and engine speed vs time, then plots FFT and PSD with x ticks at engine orders so can easily tell if associated with engine. Also plots spectrogram. Saves plots to another directory to allow me to go through plots rather quickly to visually see what is going on.
  See an issue where I need to ensure the bin width is for the allowable engine speed range since the peaks are spread out to the left and right currently. (IE integrate under the curve and get the peak at a point rather than an area under the curve).
  Want to eventually use for transient data and do waterfall analysis (vibration frequency vs engine speed vs amplitude (or power density)) but have stopped working on for now due to availability of nCode GlyphWorks to handle this for me now due to timeline not allowing for figuring this out. Another thing wanted to do is vibration weighting (wd, wb, wk, etc) Hope to revisit this if have downtime.
